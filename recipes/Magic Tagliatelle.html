        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta according to package directions.  (Try to time it so your pasta and sauce are done at the same time.)  Make sure to set aside 1 cup of the cooking water. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            <li>Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium-sized skillet. 
                Add onion and garlic and cook 3-5 minutes until soft.
                Add the butter and melt it down.</li>
            <li>Add the peas and the ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to low to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and return to the pot. Add the sauce, salt, and pepper.
                Toss the pasta and add enough of the cooking water to make a light sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with parsely</li>
        </ol>
