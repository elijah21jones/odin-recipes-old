    <figcaption>If you ever need something to break up an argument between two middle aged white women, 
        just barge in with these delicious scrambled eggs... a la francaise!</figcaption>

<h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p><em>How could you do this to me... question mark...</em> Maybe life <em><strong>is</strong></em> a cabaret and Luann is the star! 
        I won't be taking any etiquette lessons from this Countess, but I will be making these eggs!</p>
